A collection of data visualizations that I've produced as small, self-contained research projects.

1. Gridsearch comparison - A comparison of 4 different gridsearch options, with the resulting model accuracies and gridsearch processing times shown on a combined bar/line graph (using Seaborn).

2. Homicide rates by state - Recent homicide rates (2018-2021) for the 50 U.S. states are plotted along with demographically standardized "expected" rates. This provides a clearer sense of when differences between states are probably due to demographic composition and when they seem to be due to other factors (e.g. gun laws, law enforcement policies and practices, etc.). The data comes from the CDC Wonder database, and the plot is made using Plotly.

3. Oakland temperatures 2023 - The first half of 2023 was unseasonably cold in Oakland, CA. To show this, I recorded the difference between the actual high temperature for each day and the historical average for that date and displayed the results in an annotated line graph (using Matplotlib). Temperature data was taken from Weather Underground.

4. Violent crime rates by race - Prompted by an online discussion of media focus and the racial demographics of violent crime, I produced a bar graph (using Seaborn) to show as clearly as possible which racial combinations (offender/victim) are above and which are below what would be expected based on the size of racial groups alone (i.e. assuming random victims). The data is from the National Crime Victimization Survey.
